            Before proceeding with the use of the platform, weâ€™d like to collect your informed consent for two purposes.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Consent to publish your sNFT tokens on this platform in case you are eligible to receive these tokens. The consent is needed because the token metadata contains details which are considered personal information such as the name (or pseudonym) of the token holder and title of the contribution.</li>
                <li>Consent to collect personal information information about you, such as your contact information and your wallet address, to be used only for purposes of ATARCA research project. As a user of the platform you are part of a research experiment in which we test the applicability of the sNFT tokens to motivate Streamr community members to share their valuable contributions with the community.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            If you wish you can withdraw your consent at any time, and in that case your tokens will be removed from the platform.
            </p>
